                    <p>
                        Welcome to my website! My name is Wren Liang. I am currently in my second year at the University of British Columbia â€“ Vancouver majoring in Computer Engineering. I am passionate about technology and my personal areas of interest include space exploration, automation, and advances in entertainment technology.

                    <p>
                        I grew up in Calgary, Alberta with a love for playing sports and learning music. As a kid I mainly played baseball, with most of my summers spent training and travelling for tournaments. In the long Albertan winters, I enjoyed snowboarding and playing badminton indoors.
